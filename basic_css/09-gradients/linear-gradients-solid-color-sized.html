<span>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
But when I start to tell them,
They think I'm telling lies.</span>
<span>I say,
It's in the reach of my arms
The span of my hips,
The stride of my step,
The curl of my lips.</span>
<span>I'm a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,
That's me.
  — Maya Angelou
