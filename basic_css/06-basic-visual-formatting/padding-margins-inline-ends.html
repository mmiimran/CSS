The text in this paragraph contains a <code>span</code> element that has been given <span>inline-start and inline-end padding and negative inline-start and -end margins, plus a background, which causes some interesting effects</span>.  The extra space you see at the beginning and end of the <code>span</code> and the observed overlap of other content are to be expected.

The text in this paragraph contains a <code>span</code> element that has been given <span>block-start and block-end padding, plus a background, which causes some interesting effects</span>.  The extra space you see above and below the <code>span</code> and the observed overlap of other content are to be expected.
