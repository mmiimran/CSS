<body>

<p>
This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of its 
descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.  Therefore, the absolutely
positioned <b>boldface</b> element it contains will be positioned with 
respect to the initial containing block.
</p>
<p class="contain">
Thanks to <code>position: relative</code>, this paragraph establishes a containing 
block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.  
Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a boldfaced element 
that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect to its containing 
block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the element box generated 
by the paragraph.
