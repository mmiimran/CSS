<h2>Subheadings</h2>
<p>It is the case that not every heading can be a main heading.  Some headings must be
subheadings.  Examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Headings that are less important</li>
<li>Headings that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
<li>Headings that like to be dominated</li>
</ol>
<p>Letâ€™s restate that for the record:
<ol>
<li>Headings that are less important</li>
<li>Headings that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
<li>Headings that like to be dominated</li>
</ol>
